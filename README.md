              ##Description:

The following are the brief descriptions of libraries employed in program, a python scipt. 
1. Pandas :
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Relevant data is very important in data science. Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data. 
2. NumPy :
NumPy library is the important part in analyzing. NumPy(i.e., Numerical Python ) library is
used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, matrices
3. Matplotlib :
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library used for creating static, animated visualizations in
python. It is the numerical extension of Numpy. It produces quality figures in different formats. Matplotlib is used in web application servers, Python scripts, and graphical user interfaces applications. The variable plots that can be plot using Matplotlib are Line plot, Histogram, Scatter plot, 3D plot, Image plot, Scatter plot. 
4. Seaborn :
Seaborn is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a very high-level interface for
drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It’s functions operate on dataframes and
arrayswhich contain total datasets. It internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical
aggregation to produce informative plots.
5. Folium maps :
Folium maps is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data and also for analyzing the
location. Folium is a python wrapper for Leaflet.js. It's an excellent tool for plotting maps. It provides
folium.Map() class which takes latitude and longitude as parameters and generates a map around it. 
6. Arima :
ARIMA is an acronym that stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average. This is
one of the easiest and effective machine learning algorithm to performing time series forecasting. This
is the combination of Auto Regression and Moving average. Autoregression is a time series model that uses observations from previous time steps as input
to the regression equation to predict the value at the next time step. In simple words, it performs
regression in previous time step t-1 to predict t. Now MA stands for moving average which is also
called as rolling mean. 
7. Prophet :
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on
an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus
holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of
historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers
well. 
Prophet is open source software released by Facebook’s Core Data Science team. Prophet is used in many
applications across Facebook for producing reliable forecasts for planning and goal setting.

Methodology
The method adopted is divided into 3 parts. 
 Data Analysis
 Data Visualization
 Data Prediction
The 3 stages together complete the project. Some of key stages of Machine Learning are ordered into Data
Analysis and Prediction parts. All the libraries discussed above were incorporated in any of the the parts
mentioned. The error calculation and plotting is also accomlished in last part
